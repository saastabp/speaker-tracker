# Speaker Tracker — UX Reconciliation

> **Status: essentially complete — all pages reconciled (branch `ux-reconciliation`, 2026-07-23 →
> 07-25).** §1 Dashboard, §2 Pipeline (board + modals), §2b Opportunity detail, §3 Venues, §4
> Contacts, §5 History, §6 Templates, §7 Targets — all shipped & browser-verified; §8 Nav was
> reconciled early via `AppShell`. Per-section banners record what shipped, what was deferred (mostly
> backend-dependent: `follow_ups`/0009, slice-6a email composer, summary fields the API lacks), and
> the few WON'T-DO decisions. App-wide: mockup radius/brand-border theme + shared `FieldLabel` /
> `FilterBar` / `detailCards` / `opportunityChips` / `venueChips` / `contactChips`. Remaining open
> items are all tagged DEFER/PARTIAL and belong to later slices.

**Source of truth:** `samples/speaker-tracker-mockup.html` (Donna-approved) + the mockup-render
screenshots. Line refs below (`mL###`) point into that HTML file.

**Dispositions:**
- **FIX** — build/change to match the approved mockup.
- **KEEP** — implementation deviates on purpose (recorded decision or reasonable real-app addition);
  do **not** revert. Confirm at triage.
- **DEFER** — needs backend/surfaces from a later slice; do not half-build now.

**Method:** one page at a time as a self-contained unit, per-mutation approval, `ruff`/tests where
backend is touched. Check items off as they land.

---

## Shared / cross-boundary items (build once, reused by several pages)

- [ ] **Filter-chip + search row** — a reusable top-of-list toolbar (search box + pill filters).
  Reused by Venues, Contacts, History (and Emails in 6a). Build with the first list page (Venues).
- [ ] **Follow-up scheduling** — **DEFER.** The mockup places it in the Log Outreach modal, New
  Opportunity modal, Opportunity detail, Venue detail, and Contact detail, but it writes to
  `follow_ups`, which ships in `0008_followups.sql` (**slice 7 — not yet migrated**). Tag every
  follow-up finding DEFER; do not half-build UI against a missing table.
- [ ] **Email surfaces on detail pages** — **DEFER** to slice 6a: "Compose email" buttons and
  per-contact/per-venue Emails cards, email-thread views.
- [ ] **Talks & Materials screen + one-step attach** — **DEFER** to the Talks & Materials slice.
- [ ] **Dashboard aggregate drill-down** — **DEFER** to DEV-PLAN slice 8 (click an aggregate → the
  filtered summary list). Not in the mockup; a new feature. Prerequisite is the list filter rows
  this pass builds, so don't wire click handlers during reconciliation.

## 1. Dashboard  (`pages/Dashboard.tsx` vs mL382–443)

> **✅ SHIPPED & browser-verified (2026-07-23).** All FIX items done (greeting, week/tz subtitle,
> funnel conversion %, Delivered row, money sub-counts + pro-bono tile, Coming-up card, two-column
> layout, Stale demoted). KEEP: "% of goal" tile subtitle; DROP: card hint sub-headers (Brian).
> Added `research_incomplete` to Needs attention (any not-research-ready venue → links to venue).
> DEFERRED: "+ Log outreach" header button (needs contact-picker), funnel-leak caveat, richer
> needs-attention timing reasons (need `follow_ups`/0009 — see [[ticklers-reminders-future]]).
> Backend: `0007_target_labels` + dashboard repo/model additions (deployed to sandbox).

**High**
- [ ] FIX — Restore personalized header "Good morning, Donna" (generic "Dashboard" title now) — mL384
- [ ] FIX — Restore week-of + timezone subtitle ("Week of Jul 13 – 19 · Kauaʻi (HST)") — mL384
- [ ] FIX — Restore primary "+ Log outreach" action button in the page head — mL385
- [ ] FIX — Restore the "Coming up" schedule card (dated agenda list) — mL429–438
- [ ] FIX — Funnel: render stage-to-stage **conversion %** (e.g. 39/57/75%), not just raw counts — mL399–402
- [ ] FIX — Restore "Pro bono" as a money stat tile (w/ "visibility gigs" sub-label); currently demoted to a text line — mL412

**Medium**
- [ ] FIX — Money card title "Revenue & payments — Q3" (now "Money") — mL407
- [ ] FIX — Funnel card title "Pipeline funnel — Q3 to date" (now "Funnel — reached or beyond") — mL396
- [ ] FIX — Restore funnel-leak annotation ("1 booked gig cancelled — still counts as booked…") — mL403
- [x] DROP — Card hint sub-headers ("conversion between stages" / "paid gigs only" / "outreach + payments"): **not reproduced** (Brian 2026-07-23). Illustrative microcopy; and "paid gigs only" is wrong — the money card shows the pro-bono count. — mL396/407/418
- [ ] FIX — Stat tiles: guarantee the four signed-off metric labels (New venues researched, Outreach touches, Pitches sent, Gigs booked) — mL388–391
- [x] KEEP — Per-tile subtitle stays the neutral **"% of goal"**, not the mockup's interpretive sentences (Brian 2026-07-23): that detail belongs in Needs Attention / Coming Up, not duplicated per tile. — mL388–391
- [ ] FIX — Money tiles: restore supporting sub-counts (Outstanding "2 invoiced", Received "2 collected", Booked "3 paid gigs") — mL409–411
- [ ] KEEP? — "Stale — needs a nudge" card is an EXTRA (not in mockup); it occupies the mockup's "Coming up" slot. Decide keep-alongside vs replace at triage — impl only

**Low**
- [ ] FIX — "Needs attention" chips: restore the richer status vocabulary (Overdue pay / day-counts / Awaiting pay / "1/3") — mL421–425
- [ ] FIX — Right-column pairing: mockup pairs "Needs attention" with "Coming up" — mL416–439

---

## 2. Pipeline  (`pages/Pipeline.tsx` + `OpportunityFormModal` + `LogOutreachModal`)

> **Board: Tier 1 + Tier 2 SHIPPED & browser-verified (2026-07-23).** Tier 1: stage-color dots,
> subtitle, "+ New opportunity", footer note, kept Log-outreach button, approved payment-chip
> colors, warm-panel column background + uppercase headers, **Recently-closed column**, app-wide
> sentence-case badges. Tier 2: card leads with venue + "talk · format" line + type chip — needed
> `talk_title` + `organization_type` added to `_SUMMARY_SELECT`/model/api (deployed).
> **DEFERRED:** Tier 3 (due/overdue, research N/3, warm-intro — need `follow_ups`/0009), removing
> the free-text `title` field (revisit at the Opportunity detail page).
> **Modals: REWORKED to the mockup & browser-verified (2026-07-24).** Log Outreach: uppercase
> `FieldLabel`s throughout, Template + editable Message split (merge fills `[Name]`, "there"
> fallback, Copy-to-clipboard), picker always visible (un-gated), channel segmented (email
> excluded), Kind kept. New Opportunity: `FieldLabel`s + mockup order, **title derived from venue +
> talk** (free-text field dropped), **Starting stage / Lead contact / Payment status** now built —
> via a new backend `OpportunityCreateInput` + create-seed (atomic: one `status_events` row at the
> chosen stage, lead linked `is_primary`, non-terminal-stage guard; 59 backend tests green). Payment
> status shown only for paid comp. Shared `FieldLabel` + `BRAND_MUTED`/`BRAND_FAINT` added to
> `theme.ts`. **Still DEFERRED:** the follow-up blocks in both (need `follow_ups`/0009); event-date
> free-text coarse dates (kept the native picker — data-model).

## 2b. Opportunity detail  (`pages/OpportunityDetail.tsx` + `CloseOpportunityModal`)

> **✅ SHIPPED & browser-verified (2026-07-24).** Rebuilt to the mockup (mL490–560): breadcrumb,
> header chip row (stage · comp · payment · date), two-column grid — left: Details (key-value card
> with stage chip) / Payment (editable, kept) / Notes (add-at-top) / Lifecycle; right: Venue card
> (avatar + type·location via `useOrganization`, no backend change) / On-this-gig (avatars + Lead
> chip). Close modal restyled (FieldLabels, defaults-by-stage explainer, footer hint). Shared
> `opportunityChips.ts` (stage/payment colours + money) extracted from Pipeline.
> **DEFERRED:** Next-follow-up card (needs `follow_ups`/0009); Close modal reason-catalog + date
> (backend). **KEEP:** editable Payment card + Delete button (real-app needs beyond the mockup).

## App-wide (this session)

> **Theme radii + brand borders (`theme.ts`):** the app was near-square (Mantine ~4px default). Added
> the mockup radius scale — modal 14px, cards 12px, inputs/segmented 9px, chips/avatars pill — plus
> warm brand-line (`#E7DCC9`) input borders. Applies to every modal/card/input.
> **Optional Title reinstated:** the mockup dropped the free-text title, which left board cards
> showing only the venue. Re-added an optional Title (validation: title *or* talk required; blank →
> talk name); card sub-line is now `<format>: <title>`. Frontend-only (title column stays NOT NULL).

> demoted to org subtitle. Detail: breadcrumb, header (type chip + website + ready), two-column grid
> — Research–Kindling / Opportunities (client-side filter of `useOpportunities` by org) / Contacts
> (kept `AffiliationRow`) / Details (Type/Location/Added); Log-touch opens the outreach modal.
> Modal: FieldLabels, mockup field order, Research–Kindling divider, kind-hint callout, "Save,
> finish research later". Promoted shared `components/detailCards.tsx` + `venueChips.ts`.
> **DEFERRED (backend):** Last-touch + research fraction (venue summary lacks both); Activity panel
> (no org-scoped timeline); Source field (column exists in 0002, not in model/API); warmth chips +
> on-this-gig contacts + Compose email (6a) + Next-follow-up (0009). **KEEP:** editable
> `AffiliationRow`, Delete, Log-outreach + Email-domain + Notes (impl extras).

## 7. Targets  (`pages/Targets.tsx` vs mL1026–1068)

> **✅ Visual polish SHIPPED & browser-verified (2026-07-25), frontend-only.** The mockup's
> progress-list rebuild was **REJECTED by Brian** (2026-07-25): Targets is the *setting* surface only
> — actual-vs-goal **progress already lives on the Dashboard**, so a per-row meter would duplicate it;
> and **"+ New target" isn't supportable** (targets are a fixed catalog, each tied to a specific
> Dashboard aggregation — you can't add an arbitrary one without building the backend rollup). Kept
> the target×cadence editable matrix (functionally fine); polished it to the app standard: wrapped in
> a rounded `Card`, uppercase/tracked column headers, navy target labels, setting-focused subtitle
> ("…Progress is tracked on the Dashboard"). Inputs inherit the brand theme.

**High**
- [x] WON'T-DO — Progress-tracking-list rebuild — duplicates the Dashboard; Targets is setting-only (Brian) — mL1031–1068
- [x] WON'T-DO — Actual-vs-target progress meter per row — on the Dashboard already — mL1036–1064
- [x] WON'T-DO — "Actual / Goal" numeric column — on the Dashboard already — mL1037–1065

**Medium**
- [x] WON'T-DO — "+ New target" button — targets are a fixed catalog tied to backend aggregations — mL1029
- [x] KEEP — Inline-editable cells (save on blur) instead of a per-row Edit button — impl only
- [x] KEEP — Three editable cadence columns (the setting matrix) vs a single cadence chip — mL1035–1063
- [x] KEEP — Setting-focused subtitle instead of the mockup's two-hours-a-week framing — mL1028

**Low**
- [ ] PARTIAL — Two-line target labels — names wrap; no separate helper copy (no field) — mL1034–1062
- [x] FIX — Column headers polished (Target / Weekly / Monthly / Quarterly, uppercase) — mL1032

## 8. Nav / chrome  (`components/AppShell.tsx` + `main.tsx` vs mL340–376)

**High**
- [ ] FIX — Group/section headings: Relationships / Outreach / Growth (now flat) — mL356/361/366
- [ ] DEFER — "Compose" nav item + `/composer` route (6a) — mL364

**Medium**
- [ ] FIX — Nav label "Venues & Orgs" (now "Venues") — mL357
- [ ] DEFER — Nav label "Talks & Materials" (now "Talks") — becomes real with the Talks slice — mL368
- [ ] FIX — Nav order (Dashboard/Pipeline/History cluster; then Relationships; then Outreach; then Growth) — mL351–368
- [ ] FIX — 360 Balanced Living logo in the sidebar (text-only now) — mL346–348
- [ ] DEFER — Emails/Talks currently route to Placeholder — resolve as those slices land — main.tsx wildcard

**Low**
- [ ] KEEP — Header auth controls (email + Sign in/out) — real-world chrome, not in the static mockup — impl only
